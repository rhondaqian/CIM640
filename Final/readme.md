# CIM640 Final Project 

## Possible Ideas

### 1.Use p5.play to create a digital bird, and  include some animation, mouse interaction. When you click on the cat or the button around it, the bird will make different actions.
### 2. Use p5.collide2D to make a scene where rain keeps falling. Click the cloud button to change the speed of the rain. Use the custom draw function in p5.play to create a wind. When the wind meet the rain drop, the rain drops change their direction. Add a man with an umbrella walking on the ground. When he walks in the rain, the umbrella opens.
### 3. Combine p5.sound and p5.particle to draw an active volcano. Use keyboard to change the flow and sound of the volcano.
