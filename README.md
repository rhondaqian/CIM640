### Code plan for Practice1
##### The program is a calculator that calculates the area of right triangles. After users enter the length of two legs of a right triangle, this calculator will return the result of the area. First, I need two text input forms to let users enter the value of the triangle's two legs, and I'll have two inputs. Then I need a button to let the users click to activate my calculation function. In the function, I first get the two values of the form input, then I set the output to multiply the two values and divide the result by two. I get the final result and return it to the page.
